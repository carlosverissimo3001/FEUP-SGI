## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

#### **Scene**
  - Initial Idea
    ![Inital Idea](tp1/scenes/images/scene_idea.png)
  - Our scene consists on a replication of a pool
  - [Link to the scene file](tp1/scenes/sgi_tp1_T03_G10.xml)
  - Below are the used primitives and some examples of how they were used:
    - **MyRectangle**
      - Tables and chairs by the pool
      - Walls
      - ...
    - **MyCylinder**
      - Table and chair legs
      - Tree branches and trunk
      - Shower
    - **MySphere**
      - Balls
      - Simulate tree leaves
    - **MyTorus**
      - Lifebuoy
    - **MyTriangle**
      - Pool bar sides

#### **Issues/Problems**

- There were some difficulties on getting the torus right, but at the end, we were happy with result.
- There were some misunderstanding related how the texture component should be specified, however, at the end everything became clear.

#### **Some Screenshots**

### [TP2 - WebGL Graphic Technique Usage](tp2)

Our scene is a recreation of a small town public pool. There are two water zones: a pool and a jacuzi, a big grass field with pool chairs and tables to enjoy the sun. There's also a bar and the pool is surrounded by a beautiful garden, filled with trees.

For the second assigment, focusing on graphic techniques, we added a few animations, two of them are related to two people that were added to the scene. The other one is the waving of a flag. We also added a water shader to the pool. Walls, previously made with rectangles, were replaced with patches to improve visibility.

[Link to the scene file](tp2/scenes/sgi_tp2_T03_G10.xml)

#### Strong points of our project

- Complex animations, that include interaction between diffrent objects, for example, a person kicks a ball and it goes into the pool, which then interacts with the pool/jacuzi divider.
- We make great use of the newly introduced primitive, the patch. It is used in many configurations, such as a flag, a barrel and even the walls of the scene.
- We took the opportunity to add a water shader to the pool, which is a very interesting effect.
- Besided the water shader, we also implemented shaders that highlight objects in the scene, through a periodical change in size and color of that object.
- We also took the opportunity to organize the folders and files in a more organized way, which makes it easier to navigate through the project.

##### **Implementation of a barrel, using NURBS**

### [TP3 - Checkers](tp3)

In the third assignment, we were asked to implement a checkers game. We decided to implement a 2 player game, where each player can play against the other. The game is played on a 8x8 board, where each player has 12 pieces. The pieces can move diagonally, and can only move forward. If a piece reaches the other side of the board, it becomes a king, and can move in any direction. The game ends when one of the players has no more pieces.

There are 4 scenes(themes), each with a different setting. These can be changed through the interface.

Links to the scenes:

- [Pool](tp3/scenes/themes/pool.xml)
- [Desert](tp3/scenes/themes/desert.xml)
- [Space](tp3/scenes/themes/space.xml)
- [Underwater](tp3/scenes/themes/under_sea.xml)

#### Strong points of our project

Some of the main points of the project include:
- Realistic rendering of the board and pieces (textures and materials).
- Smooth animations, including the arc-like movement of the eaten pieces to the deposit.
- Smooth transitions between the different views of the scene.
- Visual feedback when selecting a piece as well as the possible tiles to move to.
- Sound effects for the piece selection and movement.
- Interface that allows the user to configure some aspects of the game, some of them include:
  * Theme of the scene
  * Automatic rotation of the camera when the turn changes
  * Setting the duration of the transitions between the different views of the scene
  * Setting the duration of the animations of the pieces
  * Setting the total time of the game
  * Setting the time that the player has to make a move
- The interface also allows users to do the following actions:
  * Undo the last move
  * Restart the game
- Complex and visually modern timer system that displays the time remaining for each player, as well as the total time of the game.
- Spotlight that follows the movement of the moving piece.
